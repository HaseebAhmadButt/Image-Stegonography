Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way for writers to get their creative flow going
at the beginning of the day. The writer has no idea what topic the random paragraph will be about
when it appears. This forces the writer to use creativity to complete one of three common writing challenges.
The writer can use the paragraph as the first one of a short story and build upon it.
A second option is to use the random paragraph somewhere in a short story they create.
The third option is to have the random paragraph be the ending paragraph in a short story.
No matter which of these challenges is undertaken, the writer is forced to use creativity to incorporate
the paragraph into their writing.
There was something special about this little creature. Donna couldn't quite pinpoint what it was, but she
knew with all her heart that it was true. It wasn't a matter of if she was going to try and save it,
but a matter of how she was going to save it. She went back to the car to get a blanket and when she returned
the creature was gone.
